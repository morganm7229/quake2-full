Hello! To install the mod, place the folder named "jedi" into your quake 2 directory. It should look like:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2

or something similar, depending on how your computer is set up.

To actually play it, you could either make a shortcute to your quake 2.exe (I recommend right clicking it and hitting "create shortcut" and dragging that to the desktop)
and then you can go into the properties, and at the end add +set game jedi, or you could go into the console in the game by hitting \`, and then typing "set game jedi".

The mod itself is pretty barebones. Each gun has a new name based off Star Wars (except the blaster and hyper blaster, since, well, they're already star wars)

The names are as follows:

(Super) Shotgun: (Super) Stormtrooper Sniper Rifle

Machinegun: Machinegun Laser Blaster

Chaingun: Paz Vizslas Chain Laser Rifle

Grenade Launcher: Force Grenade Launcher

Rocket Launcher: Boba Fett Rocket Launcher

Railgun: Mini Death Star

BFG: The Jar Jar Special

The only other main feature is that you can hit M to summon "darth vader", a higher HP gladiator

You can hit N to summon Jar Jar in his true form, a giant killer high HP tank

Or you can hit O to summon Palpatine like you're JJ Abrams ready to commit blasphemy and spit on your dreams

You can hit Y to summon Kylo Ren and cry at what his character could have been

You can also hit V and see Count Dooku. Fun fact, his sith name is Darth Tyranus. Much cooler, right?

That's basically everything. As I said, barebones.
